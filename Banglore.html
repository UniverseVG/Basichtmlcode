    <h1>Brief History of Banglore</h1>
    <p>
        Legend has it that when the feudal lord Kempe Gowda was once hunting rabbits in the area, a rabbit appeared and attacked his dog. This made a great impression on Gowda and he named the place gandu bhoomi (the place of heroes). In 1537, with the assistance
        of the local king, he constructed three districts protected by a walled fort on the site.

        <li>The earliest records of a place named "Bengaluru" are found in a ninth-century temple in an area now known as "Old Bangalore".</li>
        <li>A popular myth explaining the native name Bengaluru is that it originated from Benda Kaalu Uru (Town of Boiled Beans).</li>
        <li>This above Story is told that the name was given to the city by King Vira Ballala who, while lost in the area, was offered boiled beans by an old woman. </li>

    <h2>Talk</h2>
    <p>
        Being the capital of Karnataka, the widely spoken and official language in Bangalore is Kannada. Most people can speak and understand English and Hindi. Other Indian languages such as Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and Urdu are spoken by the respective
        migrant and minority communities. As Bengaluru is a commercial and cultural hub, it has a smattering of Konkani, Marathi and Tulu speakers.
